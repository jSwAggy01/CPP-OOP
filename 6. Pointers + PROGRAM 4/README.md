# Pointers in C++

## Overview

Pointers are a fundamental concept in C++ that allow you to work with memory addresses directly. They are powerful but can be error-prone if not used carefully. This README provides a quick overview of pointers in C++.

## Declaration and Initialization

```cpp
int* ptr;             // Declare a pointer to an integer
int* ptr = nullptr;   // Initialize a pointer to nullptr (recommended)
int* ptr = &myVar;    // Initialize with the address of a variable
```

## Accessing Values

```cpp
int x = *ptr;         // Access the value pointed to by ptr
```

## Pointer Arithmetic

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int* ptr = arr;

*ptr;         // 1 (first element)
*(ptr + 2);   // 3 (third element)
```

## Null Pointers

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;  // Pointer is null, not pointing to any valid memory
## Pointer to Pointer (Double Pointer)

int x = 10;
int* ptr1 = &x;
int** ptr2 = &ptr1;  // Pointer to a pointer
```

## Passing Pointers to Functions

```cpp
void modifyValue(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 42;        // Modifies the value at the address pointed to by ptr
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int* ptr = &x;
    modifyValue(ptr);
    // x is now 42
}
```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;   // Allocate memory on the heap
delete ptr;           // Deallocate memory to prevent memory leaks
```

## Common Pitfalls
- Dangling Pointers: Using a pointer after the pointed-to object has been deleted.
- Memory Leaks: Forgetting to release memory allocated with new.

## Conclusion
Pointers are a powerful feature of C++, enabling low-level memory manipulation. However, they come with responsibilities and risks, so use them carefully and consider modern C++ alternatives like smart pointers when possible.
