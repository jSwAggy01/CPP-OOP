## Search Algorithms

### Linear Search

- **Description:** Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that scans an array or list sequentially to find a target element.
- **Algorithm:** Iterate through the elements one by one until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
- **Efficiency:** Linear time complexity O(n) for an unsorted list, where n is the number of elements.
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for small lists or unsorted data.

### Binary Search

- **Description:** Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm used with sorted arrays or lists.
- **Algorithm:** Divide the sorted array into two halves, compare the middle element with the target, and eliminate half of the search space at each step.
- **Efficiency:** Logarithmic time complexity O(log n), which is faster than linear search, but the data must be sorted.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for large sorted datasets where quick searches are needed.

## Sort Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

- **Description:** Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Algorithm:** Iterate through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them until no swaps are needed.
- **Efficiency:** Quadratic time complexity O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.
- **Use Cases:** Rarely used in practice due to its inefficiency on large datasets.

### Selection Sort

- **Description:** Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region and repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.
- **Algorithm:** Find the minimum element in the unsorted region and swap it with the first element of the unsorted region.
- **Efficiency:** Quadratic time complexity O(n^2), making it inefficient for large datasets.
- **Use Cases:** Not recommended for large datasets but simple to implement.

### Insertion Sort

- **Description:** Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by shifting elements to their correct positions.
- **Algorithm:** Start with the second element, compare it with the previous elements, and insert it into the correct position in the sorted part.
- **Efficiency:** Quadratic time complexity O(n^2), but it is efficient for small datasets or partially sorted data.
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for small datasets or when the data is nearly sorted.

### Merge Sort

- **Description:** Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges the sorted sublists back together.
- **Algorithm:** Divide the list in half, recursively sort each half, and merge the sorted halves.
- **Efficiency:** Efficient and stable sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n).
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for sorting large datasets, but it requires additional memory for the merging step.

### Quick Sort

- **Description:** Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the list into two sublists: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
- **Algorithm:** Recursively sort the two sublists and concatenate them around the pivot.
- **Efficiency:** Efficient and widely used sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).
- **Use Cases:** Suitable for sorting large datasets and often outperforms other sorting algorithms in practice.

These are some of the fundamental search and sort algorithms used in computer science. The choice of algorithm depends on factors like data size, data organization, and desired performance characteristics.
