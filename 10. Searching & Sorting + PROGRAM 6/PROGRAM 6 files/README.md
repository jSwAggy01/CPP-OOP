# IntList and SortedSet Programs

## IntList Program

### Program Overview

This program provides a class for creating and manipulating linked lists of integers. It includes functions for adding elements to the front and back of the list, displaying the list, clearing the list, and performing selection sort on the list.

### Usage

The "IntList" program can be used to create and manipulate linked lists of integers. Here are some of the key operations:

- **Constructor/Destructor**: The program demonstrates the construction and destruction of linked lists.

- **Push Front/Pop Front**: You can add elements to the front of the list using `push_front`, and you can remove elements from the front using `pop_front`.

- **Push Back**: You can add elements to the back of the list using `push_back`.

- **Display**: The program can display the contents of the list.

- **Clear**: You can clear the list using the `clear` function.

- **Copy Constructor and Assignment**: The program demonstrates the use of copy constructors and assignment operators.

- **Selection Sort**: It shows how to sort the list using the selection sort algorithm.

- **Insert Ordered**: You can insert an element into the list while maintaining sorted order using `insert_ordered`.

### Program Execution

To run the "IntList" program, compile it with the provided compilation command and execute it. The program will perform various tests and display the results.

## SortedSet Program

### Program Overview

This program provides a class for creating and manipulating sorted sets of integers. It includes functions for creating sets, performing set operations (union and intersection), adding elements to sets, and displaying sets.

### Usage

The "SortedSet" program can be used to create and manipulate sorted sets of integers. Here are some of the key operations:

- **Constructor/Destructor**: The program demonstrates the construction and destruction of sorted sets.

- **Add**: You can add elements to a set using the `add` function.

- **Union Operator (|)**: You can perform the union of two sets using the `|` operator.

- **Intersection Operator (&)**: You can perform the intersection of two sets using the `&` operator.

- **Display**: The program can display the contents of a set.

### Program Execution

To run the "SortedSet" program, compile it with the provided compilation command and execute it. The program will perform various tests of sorted sets and display the results.

This "IntList" and "SortedSet" program is a useful tool for understanding and working with linked lists and sorted sets of integers.
