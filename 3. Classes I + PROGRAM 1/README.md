# Classes in C++

Classes in C++ are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). They serve as blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions). Classes are used to structure and organize code, making it more modular, maintainable, and reusable.

## Key Concepts

1. **Objects**: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities or concepts and encapsulate both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) related to those entities.

2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of OOP. It refers to the bundling of data and functions into a single unit, the class. Access to the internal data is controlled through member functions, allowing for data hiding and abstraction.

3. **Data Members**: Data members are variables declared within a class that represent the attributes or properties of objects. They define the state of objects.

4. **Member Functions**: Member functions (methods) are functions declared within a class that define the behaviors or operations that objects can perform. They manipulate the data members and implement the class's functionality.

5. **Constructor**: A constructor is a special member function used for initializing objects when they are created. Constructors have the same name as the class and are automatically called when an object is instantiated.

6. **Destructor**: A destructor is a special member function used to clean up resources and perform finalization tasks when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~).

7. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows one class (the derived or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (the base or superclass). It supports code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures.

8. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows for dynamic method invocation based on the actual object type, facilitating flexibility and extensibility.

9. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling them using classes and objects. It hides unnecessary implementation details and focuses on essential features.

10. **Class Members**: Class members can be classified as public, private, or protected. Public members are accessible from outside the class, private members are only accessible within the class, and protected members are accessible within the class and derived classes.

## Benefits of Classes

- **Modularity**: Classes promote modularity by encapsulating related data and functions, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

- **Reusability**: Once defined, classes can be reused in various parts of a program or in different programs, reducing duplication of code.

- **Abstraction**: Classes hide complex implementation details, allowing developers to focus on high-level design and functionality.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance supports the creation of new classes based on existing ones, enabling code reuse and specialization.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enhances flexibility and extensibility by allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly.

- **Data Integrity**: Encapsulation and access control (public, private, protected) help ensure data integrity by preventing unauthorized access and modification of data.

## Example

Here's a simplified example of a C++ class:

>	class Student {
>	private:
>	    std::string name;
>	    int age;

>	public:
>	    // Constructor
>	    Student(const std::string& n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
>	
>	    // Member function to get the student's name
>	    std::string getName() const {
>	        return name;
>	    }
>	
>	    // Member function to get the student's age
>	    int getAge() const {
>	        return age;
>	    }
>	};
